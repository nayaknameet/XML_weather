Requirements:
Python 3.6
You need to have libraries - requests, beautifulsoap4.


How to run:
1> Run the code.
2> It will ask you to enter values. You can find different values from(http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/index.xml)
3> It will then display max temperature, min temperature, max dew-point, min dew-point, wind speed, wind direction and weather(in some cases).
4> It will then ask you to refresh, please press 'Y' or 'y' to refresh it, it will use the same inputs given earlier.
5> If pressed anything except 'Y' and 'y' the program will assume you are done and terminate.

Assumptions:
 - User will enter precise values.
 - 'weather' means how cloudy it will be.
 - Refreshing means to refresh with same values.
 
 
Limitations:
If you want to enter new values you have to re-run the code.
